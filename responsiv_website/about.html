        <h2 style="color:#ffffff";>About Me</h2>

          <p>
     	      I am Priyaranjan singh and live in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. 
     	      I am 19 years old and web designing is my passion. According to me calling a stuff your
     	      passion isn't worth it unless you make effort to accomplish it and most importantly you
     	      should love the work you do. So this website is used for guiding web developers for 
     	      creating responsive website for Beginners, who are new to this field. 

     	      There are some videos covered in this site which will help you out for developing websites.
     	      After having a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP you are all set to make a profitable website.
     	      So without wasting time in long lectures......
     	      I would rather say "Just Bring it on...!!!!"

          </p>
